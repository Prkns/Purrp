# Change Log

## 0.0.4 - Amended overall colours

💜 After much deliberation, a full-scale overhaul of the theme needed to happen. There wasn't enough purple, that's basically it. Plenty more purple tones so that Purrp! is now deserving of it's name.

Most of the updates have been tested on languages used most often by myself (listed below). More languages will be getting updated down the line.

- SCSS/SASS/CSS
- Javascript
- Json
- Markdown
- Yaml

Please request other languages or report issues with others that may have been missed.

## 0.0.3 - Refinements

There were a few issues with contrasting and ill-fitting colour choices for a couple of UI elements. These have now been fixed along with a test of a new contrasting cursor colour. Still keeping this in "Preview" mode for the time being until some more work has been done to the actual syntax colours.

## 0.0.2 - Added Basic Twig Support

🌳 Basing the testing off Craft CMS, the first stage of Twig templating syntax colours are now added.

---

## 0.0.1 - Started Development

🙌🏻 First smash through of colours and syntax theming. Version 0.0.1 for previewing!
