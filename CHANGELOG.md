# Change Log

## 0.0.3 - Refinements

There were a few issues with contrasting and ill-fitting colour choices for a couple of UI elements. These have now been fixed along with a test of a new contrasting cursor colour. Still keeping this in "Preview" mode for the time being until some more work has been done to the actual syntax colours.
